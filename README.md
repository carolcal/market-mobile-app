# Market List Mobile App

## Description

This project is a mobile app that functions as a shopping cart, allowing users to easily add items they wish to purchase to a list. The app renders all the item information and calculates the total payment value, making it convenient for users to see the final cost. To enhance usability, I also implemented individual delete buttons for each item, as well as a convenient "delete all" button. The project was created using vanilla JavaScript, and I utilized Firebase for data storage.
